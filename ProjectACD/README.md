# Project ACD

This project allows a phone user to send commands to their computer for remote execution or status update purposes.

## Specifics

For this program to successfully run, two prerequisites must be met:

1. You must have a "server" running on your PC.
2. You must have the application on your mobile device.

Once these prerequisites have been met, you can begin sending commands!
